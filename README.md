# csc221: Numerical Analysis
Introduction to numerical analysis using python.

## Projects

### Assignment 2: Summation
A project to test various methods of summation and the differences in computation time and accuracy between them.

### Assignment 3: Taylor Series
A project to test various Taylor Series and how the number of iterations affects computation time and accuracy.

### Assignment 4: Differentiation
A project to test various methods of differentiation and the differences in computation time and accuracy between them.

### Assignment 5: Integration
A project to test various methods of integration and the differences in computation time and accuracy between them.

### Final Project: Numerical Root Finding
A research project in which we had to choose our own topics in numerical analysis and write a report on the topic. I choose to research numerical root finding and the differences in computation time and accuracy between the various methods.
